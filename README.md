# juggler-sequence
Juggler Sequence is a series of integer number in which the first term starts with a positive integer number a and the remaining terms are generated from the immediate previous term using the below recurrence relation : 
Juggler Sequence starting with number 3: 
```
5, 11, 36, 6, 2, 1
```
Juggler Sequence starting with number 9: 
```
9, 27, 140, 11, 36, 6, 2, 1
```
Given a number n we have to print the Juggler Sequence for this number as the first term of the sequence. 
Examples: 
```
Input: 9
Output: 9, 27, 140, 11, 36, 6, 2, 1
We start with 9 and use above formula to get
next terms.

Input: 6
Output: 6, 2, 1
```
